## 1. Intro
Before starting, I would like to give a special thanks to NetworkChuck for the excellent [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9fSMGkjtug&list=LL&index=42&t=0s) on how to set up a Raspberry Pi cluster.

This documentation page closely follows that video's instructions, with some changes to reflect some of the updates that have been made to the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).

**Make sure to follow the steps in this guide for all your Raspberry Pis.**

## 2. Pre-requisites

There is a single prerequisite for this guide:

- Download and install [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

<Note>This guide shows how to setup a **Raspberry Pi 5** using Raspeberry Pi imager **v1.8.5**</Note>

## 3. Install OS

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Device">
  First, select your device. In this case, we are using a Raspberry Pi 5.
    <img
    className="block"
    src="/images/rpi-select-device.gif"
    alt="rpi-select-device"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose OS">
    Select **Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64-bit** as your headless OS.
    <img
    className="block"
    src="/images/rpi-select-os.gif"
    alt="rpi-select-os"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your storage">
    Select the storage device where you want to install the operating system.
    <img
    className="block"
    src="/images/rpi-select-storage.png"
    alt="rpi-select-os"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Hostname, Username and Password">
    Under the **General** tab, set your hostname, username and password.
    The password you set here will be used when connecting to your node via SSH.
    <Tip> **Tip:** Use the same name for Username and Hostname for consistency.</Tip>
    <img
    className="block"
    src="/images/rpi-set-hostname.gif"
    alt="rpi-set-hostname"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable SSH">
    Enable SSH under the **Services** tab.
    <img
    className="block"
    src="/images/rpi-enable-ssh.gif"
    alt="rpi-enable-ssh"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Save the changes, and let the Imager set everything up.
    <img
    className="block"
    src="/images/rpi-save-os.png"
    alt="rpi-save-os"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Boot up your Pi">
    Take the storage with the OS installed on it and connect to the Pi, power it up and allow it approximately 5 minutes to complete the boot process.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## 3. Enable Cgroups
As mentioned in the [K3s docs](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/requirements?_highlight=cgroup_memory%3D1&_highlight=cgroup_enable%3Dmemory&os=pi#cgroups), standard Raspberry Pi OS installations do not start with `cgroups` enabled. **K3S** requires `cgroups` to start the systemd service.

The following steps will guide you through enabling cgroups on your Pi.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reconnect the OS storage device to your computer">
  After letting your Pi boot for the first time, turn it off and reconnect the OS storage to your computer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open cmdline.txt">
    Open your OS storage device, navigate to and open the file named `cmdline.txt`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable cgroups">
    Add the following code to the end of the file:
    ```
    cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory
    ```

    You should end up with something like this:
    <img
    className="block"
    src="/images/rpi-edit-cmdlinetxt.png"
    alt="rpi-edit-dmlinetxt"
    />
    After that do not forget to save.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Boot up your pi (again)">
    After editing `cmdline.txt`, remove the storage device, connect it to the Pi, and power it up to reboot.  
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Setting a static IP
Now all that is left is to set a static IP to whatever we would like to have.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to your Pi via SSH">
    Open the terminal and connect to your Pi using:
    ```bash
    ssh <username>@<hostname>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the IP">
    To set a static IP, we define:
    - `ipv4.addresses` – The IP of this machine.
    - `ipv4.gateway` – The router or default gateway.
    - `ipv4.dns` – The DNS server to use (probably same as router).
    - `ipv4.dns` – Leave it manual.

    Define these values and use them for the following command:
    ```bash
    nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" \
    ipv4.addresses <your_desired_ip>/24 \
    ipv4.gateway <ip_of_router> \
    ipv4.dns <ip_of_router> \ 
    ipv4.method manual
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reboot Pi">
    For these changes to take effect we need to reboot our Pi.
    ```bash
    reboot
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
