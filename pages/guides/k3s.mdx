description: 'Set up the kubernetes cluster'
---


## 1. Intro
In this documentation, you'll learn how to install K3s and set up your Kubernetes cluster using the Single Server Architecture explained in the [K3s Architecture](/pages/architecture/k3s-architecture) page.

This guide closely follows NetworkChuck's excellent [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9fSMGkjtug&list=LL&index=42&t=0s) on setting up a Raspberry Pi cluster—feel free to check it out!

## 2. Pre-requisites

This guide assumes that:
- You have followed the [Raspberry Pi setup](/page/guides/raspberrypi) guide.
- You have all your compute nodes connected to the same network.

## 3. Setup the Server Node

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to your Server Node via SSH">
    Open the terminal and connect to your Pi using:
    ```bash
    ssh <username>@<hostname>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install K3s">
    After connecting, install k3s on your node
    ```bash
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Server Token">
    With k3s installed, now we need to get the Server Token, so we can use it to register the Agent nodes.
    ```bash
    cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token
    ```
    <Note> Save this token—we'll need it for the next steps. </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Setup the Agent Nodes
Repeat this process for each agent node to connect them all to your server.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to your Server Node via SSH">
    Open the terminal and connect to your Pi using:
    ```bash
    ssh <username>@<hostname>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install K3s">
    Before installation, you'll need two things:

    - The server node **IP address**
    - The server node **token** from the previous steps.

    Use these values to complete and run the following command
    ```bash
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://<server_node_ip>:6443 K3S_TOKEN=<server_node_token> sh -
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
